    <h1>Change the look</h1>
        <p>Shopware allows for complete customization of the payment appearance using <a href="/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/storefront/customize-templates">Template extensions</a>, which enable you to extend or override the default storefront checkout design. It's worth noting that these extensions will only apply to merchants who utilize the default storefront; those who have built their storefronts from scratch may not take advantage of these extensions.</p>

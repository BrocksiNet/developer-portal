    <template #title>How to Migrate to Shopware 6?</template>
    <template #description>When looking for a new shop system, one often comes across the term "migration", but it says little about what it means for the shop in question. In this context it means a new beginning, you start with a completely new shop.

This assistant helps you to transfer your individual data to the new shop system.  In the following guides we would like to show you which steps you have to take in order to migrate successfully.</template>
